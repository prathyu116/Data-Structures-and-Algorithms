/*

Now for fib(n) we need to check if memo[n] is equal to -1 or not. If it is -1 then we can say that the problem was not solved before and we will solve it. 
But if it is other than -1 then we can say that the problem was solved before. So we donâ€™t have to solve it again. 
We will just return it.
